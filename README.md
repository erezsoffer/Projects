# Projects

This repository contains various projects that demonstrate applications of machine learning, reinforcement learning, image processing, and computer architecture. Below is an overview of each project:

## Projects Overview

### 1. Using LLMs for Software Engineering

- **Description**: 
  An automated workflow that generates, executes, and iteratively refines Python code to query a CSV file based on user input. This project utilizes Azure OpenAI for developing and correcting the code.
  
- **Features**:
  - Generates Python code based on user specifications.
  - Executes the generated code and retrieves results.
  - Iteratively refines code based on feedback and performance.
  
- **AI-Driven Agent**:
  An agent that leverages Azure OpenAI to:
  - Extract entities from text.
  - Perform internet searches to retrieve attributes.
  - Generate and execute Python programs.
  - Handle file operations.
  
- **Loop Mechanism**: 
  Processes user queries, executing functions as needed, while maintaining limits on LLM and function calls.
